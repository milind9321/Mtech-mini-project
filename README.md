# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction

This project predicts crop yield using machine learning techniques. It is focused on agricultural data from Karnataka, India.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Predicts crop production based on features like crop type, area, rainfall, season, and year
- Helps in making informed agricultural decisions

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- XGBoost

## 📁 Dataset

- Based on Karnataka's agricultural data
- Contains features like area, production, crop type, season, year, etc.
- Dataset is not included in this repository

## ✅ Key Features

- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Implementation of multiple ML models
- Performance comparison of models

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add real-time weather data
- Expand to datasets from other states
